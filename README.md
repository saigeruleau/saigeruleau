I'm Saige, a professional data analust with experience on more than 7 tehcincal projects. My skills include business analytics, data visualization, and storytelling. I am eager to leverage my skills in Excel, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI in the environmental sector to drive insights from data. 

Currently, I am working within the natural resources sector where I manage conservation projects for federal agencies. My previous 6+ years in environmental work has helped me develop my analytical, team work, and problem solving skills. In 2023, I enrolled in the TripleTen  5 month Data Analyst program. The curriculum covered advanced spreadsheets (Excel, Google Sheets), data collection and storage (SQL), business analytics, data visualization (Tableau, Power BI), and storytelling with data. 

Some facts about me:
- I am a life-long learner.
- I love the outdoors. I go on multi-day backpacking trips in wilderness areas.
- My goals for 2024: land my dream job in data! 

Feel free to contact me on GitHub or [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/saigeruleau). I look forward to connecting with you!
